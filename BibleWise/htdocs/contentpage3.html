			<h1 id="ti">1. Isaiah 41:10 - God strengthens you</h1>
			<p id="tp">So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
God has promised us His strength. He will never give you a trial you are unable to handle. As children of God, we can call upon His power at any time.
			</p>
			<h1 id="ti">2. Jeremiah 33:6 - God brings healing</h1>
			<p id="tp">"Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security.
Although we are aware that complete physical healing may not occur in this lifetime, we also know that God has a plan and a purpose for our lives.			
			</p>
			<h1 id="ti">3. Realize God Calls People love eachother: Luke 11:14</h1>
			<p id="tp">"Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety."
			Some people get stuck listening for that still, small voice of the Spirit when they seek guidance in a situation. But remember that God doesn't just speak directly to us. Often, he speaks to us through others. Talk about your decisions with people you trust, faith leaders and experts. And be willing to hear from God in other forms, including sermons, books and even television shows. When you're open to the spirit, you never know how it will arrive.
			</p>
			<h1 id="ti">4. Pray About Everything: Philippians 4:6</h1>
			<p id="tp">"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."
			Sometimes we're guilty of turning to God in prayer only for the major things. And while all these tips certainly apply to big decisions such as how to spend retirement savings or whether you should sell your home and move into an assisted living community, they also apply to little things.
			The Bible tells us to pray about everything. Consider praying in the morning about which assisted living activities you should engage in that day or whether any of your fellow residents could use a kind word or a smile during meal times. Other things you might pray over include how to use the time and talents God has given you, when to call a family member and what to say to someone who you feel needs encouragement or who has wronged you.
			</p>
			<h1 id="ti">5. Matthew 11:28-30 - God lightens your burdens</h1>
			<p id="tp">"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
Many times we feel overwhelmed in our Christian life. God has promised us that we can find strength in Him, and He will provide rest for us.
